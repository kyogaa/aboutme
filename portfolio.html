			<p style="text-align: center;"> 1.1.9 Flappy Bird Project 2/17/2023</p>
			<img src="images/flappypicture.JPG" height="300">
			<p style="text-align: center;"> For this project we attempted to create a parody version of flappy bird that did not use any lists. We attempted to learn and use threads, but without the use of lists came to the conclusion that there would be a memory leak that stops the program.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"> 1.2.5 Minion Muncher Project 3/14/2023</p>
			<img src="images/minionmuncher.png" height="300">
			<p style="text-align: center;"> This Minion Muncher project is a parody of snake, where as you collect more bananas, you would increase the number of minions following the initial minion. Contrary to the the flappy bird project, lists were used however the same problem with memory leaks when dealing with the timer for the game would interrupt the game.</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"> Scratch Project 3/28/2023</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;"> This scratch project was very different than previous Python projects. We created a game that involved falling objects and you had to dodge them, however added a point system if you collected specific objects that don't hurt you. It involves the use of a timer and score count, as well as a leaderboard. Elements in the game change as you gain points.</p>
